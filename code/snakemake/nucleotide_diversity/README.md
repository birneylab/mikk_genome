# Analysis of nucleotide diversity in the MIKK panel

## Reviewer comments:

> Authors should calculate the conventionally used parameter (nucleotide diversity or Pi) to summarize the genetic diversity. For this analyses, authors could do the sliding window analyses within each chromosome. The sex determination locus in Chr1 should show higher Pi. Moreover, I wonder how high the Pi is for the natural population of medaka. If MIKK's genome-wide median Pi is similar to natural medaka, it would strongly argue that MIKK has a high level of diversity.
